            <h3>Hi my name is Taylor!</h3>
            <br>

        <p> I love to crochet, I have been crocheting since I was little and I want to share my crafts with everyone. My late Grandma taught me the craft at a young age and it was something I picked up quickly and learned to love. 
        Today I continute to crochet to remeber her and make her proud. Crocheting is a relaxing hobby that helps me destress after a long day. I have always loved making people smile and my amiguru-mates get the job done well.</p> </div>


        <div class="item2">  <h2> What is Amigurimi?</h2> 
        
        <h3>Amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting small stuffed yarn creations</h3>
        
        <p>In Japanese“Ami” translates to crocheted or knitted  “Kurtumi” translates to wrapping“nuigurumi” translates to stuffed doll. 
        The root of the art is hard to pin down, however, amigurumi dolls began to appear in Japan during the 1970s. It is also known that art has been around for many years before that.
        There is a lot of creative freedom when making aigurumi's, they can vary in shape, color, and size. </p> </div>
